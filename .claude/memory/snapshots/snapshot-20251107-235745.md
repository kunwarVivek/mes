## Recovery Instructions

**When resuming after compaction:**

1. **Load Context**
   - Read this snapshot first
   - Review "Working Plan" section
   - Check "Active Work" for current status

2. **Resume Work**
   - Continue from "Next Steps"
   - Reference "Key Decisions Made" for context
   - Check "Pending Work" for remaining tasks

3. **Verify State**
   - Run tests to confirm current state
   - Check git status for uncommitted changes
   - Review metrics for session progress

4. **Seamless Continuation**
   - User should not notice the compaction
   - All context preserved
   - Work continues without interruption
